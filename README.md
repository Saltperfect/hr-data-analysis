# hr-data-analysis
Analysised the HR data set which can be seen [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/downloads/HR_comma_sep.csv)
There were many columns like satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_of_projects, average_monthly_hours, time_spend_company, Work_accident, left, promotion_last_5years, job_background, salary_bracket.

After plotting satisfaction level with last_evaluation found 3 significat spots in the scatter plot. 
The left top spot suggest that many are not realising their potential and just working for job security.
The middle spot also tells that these are same type of people but with some conservative answers to the questions.
The right top spot tells that there are some people who are valuable and happy in what they are doing.

Getting right on to the people on spot number on right top we can see that most work in sales and the technical and so on.
Most had less, medium income and worked for longer hours.
